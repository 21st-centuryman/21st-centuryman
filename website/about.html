  <h3>About</h3>
  <p> I am a Swedish electronics and computer engineering graduate at KTH, the Royal Institute of Technology in
    Stockholm. </p>
  <p> I have a deep interest in tech; be it messing around with Linux servers, building my own cpu using Verilog,
    creating websites, writing scripts, or AI. </p>
  <p> I am still trying to figure out what I should specialize in. To see my projects I have created at school, work, or
    personal, check out my <a href="https://github.com/21st-centuryman" target="_blank">Github</a> </p>
