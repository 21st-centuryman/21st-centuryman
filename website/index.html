  <h3>Alexander Berg</h3>
  <p>I got tired of always updating my web dev websites with new projects and images.</p>
  <p>At this point I have created over 5 of them in different frameworks and libraries.</p>
  <p>Including React, Vue, Leptos, Zola, etc. If you wanna see them you can email me.</p>
  <p>Now, instead of that, I created this simple HTML file to cut to the chase.</p>
  <br />
  <h3>My favorite projects</h3>
  <a href="https://github.com/21st-centuryman/Homelab">Homelab: </a>
  <p>A collection of the services I self-host and my experience with backend technologies like NGINX, Linux, Docker,
    etc. As well as overall networking like reverse proxy, SSL, Load balancing, etc.</p>
  <a href="https://github.com/21st-centuryman/riscy_core">Riscy Core: </a>
  <p>A 32-bit RISC V cpu I am buying on the side of the school. I am really interested in the first principles of
    computing and would like to build as much of the tech stack by hand as possible.</p>
  <a href="https://github.com/21st-centuryman/advent_of_code">Advent of code: </a>
  <p>I love programming paradigms, so I am trying to do as many days as I can in AOC using Haskell, Rust, Python, C, and
    Pytorch (basically rewriting everything in terms of tensors). In the future, I plan to do APL as well.</p>
