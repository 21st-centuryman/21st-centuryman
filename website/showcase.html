  <h3>Showcase</h3>
  <p> Below are some links to some projects I am really proud of. My goal is to eventually embed some more of them (and
    future ones) into this website using WEBGPU. As soon as I find the time.</p>

        <u>Homelab</u>
        <p>A collection of the services I self-host and my experience with backend technologies like NGINX, Linux,
          Docker, etc. As well as overall networking like reverse proxy, SSL, Load balancing, etc.</p>

        <u>Riscy Core</u>
        <p>A 32-bit RISC V cpu I am building on the side of the school. I am really interested in the first principles
          of computing and would like to build as much of the tech stack by hand as possible.</p>

        <u>Advent of code</u>
        <p>I love programming paradigms, so I am trying to do as many days as I can in AOC using Haskell, Rust, Python,
          C, and Pytorch (basically rewriting everything in terms of tensors). In the future, I plan to do Agda and APL
          as well.
