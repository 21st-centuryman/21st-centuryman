  <h3>Showcase</h3>
  <p> Below are some links to some projects I am really proud of or stuff I just had fun building. My goal is to
    eventually embed some more of the higher end ones into this website using WEBGPU. As soon as I
    find the time.</p>

        <u>Livermore</u>
        <p>A collection of two projects for fetching and training machine learning models on stock data. Livermore-fetch
          is written in Rust and Polars, it uses the yahoo finance api to process and fetch data. Livermore-analyze is a
          gym enviornment for training machine learning models on this data</p>

        <u>Homelab</u>
        <p>A collection of the services I self-host, using applications like NGINX, Proxmox, Docker, OPNSense etc. As

        <u>Advent of code</u>
        <p>I love programming paradigms, therefore I'm doing as many days as I can in AOC using Haskell, Rust, Python,
          C, and Pytorch/tinygrad. In the future, I plan to do Agda and APL as well.
