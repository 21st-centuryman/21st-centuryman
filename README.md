## ‚áÅ  Welcome
If you want to follow me, I hope you enjoy this journey.

## ‚áÅ  Current status
- üî≠ I want to accelerate technological development.
- üìñ I studied electronics and computer science at KTH 
- üå± I‚Äôm currently working on three projects.
  - Micrograd-rs: Expanding the research laid out in my thesis. Optimizing for stack allocation with Macros and Const generics.
  - Proofs: Learning Agda for mathematical proofs, with the goal to eventually merge this with Micrograd to prove properties about ML.
  - RISCY Cores: a collection of cores I have developed in SystemVerilog. The goal is to eventually build a 64 bit pipeline RISC-V CPU with all extensions and have a complete SystemVerilog to tape-out pipeline using OpenLane.
- üí§ I‚Äôm currently procrastinating on these projects.
    - Livermore: An AI to process and analyze data from Yahoo finance API. I have some bug fixes to do.
    - Advent of Code: I have set a goal to code in SystemVerilog, pytorch/tinygrad, haskell, python or rust.
    - Homelabbing: setting up a ML enviornment, and other issues, all mentioned in project.
